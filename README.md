## <p align=center> My First Useful Mini Application Generated Entirely By AI

</BR>
So, I like to watch YouTube videos on a monitor from my Windows PC while exercising with the bike. &nbsp;But since I am way too cheap to subscribe to YouTube Premium, I thought it would be nice if I could issue a voice command and have the mouse automatically click on the left mouse button when the 'Skip Ads' button appears in the YouTube video.&nbsp;

However, having not worked with the Windows platform for many years, I thought it would be a fun project to see if ChatGPT 3.5 can assist me with this.

This little application will have two main tasks.&nbsp;  First, it needs to accept my voice command.&nbsp;  Second, it simulates the left mouse button click.

So, I told ChatGPT the goal of my little application just as stated above.

And... ChatGPT guided me through the entire process. &nbsp;From creating a new Windows Forms app with VSCode, installing required components in VSCode, running compile / execute from terminal session, troubleshooting to the final working state. &nbsp; The total time I spent for this to do what I want is around 2-4 hours.

If I was to DIY myself with Googling and StackOverflow, it probably would take me a week.

It is amazing.  &nbsp;In no time, I just become a 50% engineer!
